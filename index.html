        <h2 class="heading">How the book came to be:</h2>
        <p>The inspiration for this book originated from the team at Videos That Matter based on personal experiences with family members.  There are things that are difficult to talk about, and growing old and death are at the top of the list.  When the founder’s brother, and later, his mother were near death, it fell upon him to make difficult decisions with a lot of stress and heartbreak that could have been avoided if he’d only had a conversation sooner in their time together. </p>
        <p>The focus of this book, and all the work that we do at Videos That Matter, is to stimulate conversations that promote health and wellbeing.</p>
