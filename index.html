            <h2 class="heading">How the Book came to be:</h2>
            <p>The inspiration for this book originated from the team at <a href="https://videosthatmatter.org/" target="_blank">Videos That Matter</a> based on personal experiences with family members.  There are things that are difficult to talk about, and growing old and death are at the top of the list.  When the founder’s brother, and later, his mother were near death, it fell upon him to make difficult decisions with a lot of stress and heartbreak that could have been avoided if he’d only had a conversation sooner in their time together. </p>
            <p>The focus of this book, and all the work that we do at <a href="https://videosthatmatter.org/" target="_blank">Videos That Matter</a>, is to stimulate conversations that promote health and wellbeing.</p>

              <h2 class="heading">How to Use this Book:</h2>
              <p>This book and accompanying video are meant to begin a conversation across generations, specifically, a conversation about death. It can be used with children, to explain the natural process of a grandparent’s imminent or recent death. In this way, it can prepare or help children through loss by presenting the idea that death is a natural, unavoidable part of life. Children are naturally inquisitive and won’t be fearful about this subject unless they are taught to respond that way from adults.</p>
              <p>Adults can also use it to initiate a conversation about advanced health directives with their parents. All too often, these conversations don’t happen, especially when death is treated as a taboo subject, and family members are left making difficult decisions with no knowledge of their parent’s wishes.</p>
